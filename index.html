There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal (known as the "standard route") and the other from the north in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall.</p><p class="text text_place_card text_size_m">As of November 2022, 310 people have died on Everest. Over 200 bodies remain on the mountain and have not been removed due to the dangerous conditions.</p></div></article><article class="card"><h2 class="title title_place_card title_size_m">Lhotse</h2><div class="card__website"><p class="card__url">URL</p><a target="_blank" class="link link_place_card link_size_m" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lhotse">More &rarr;</a></div><img class="card__image" src="dd32be8c9726d5dab05f.jpg" alt="Lhotse"/><div class="card__text"><p class="text text_place_card text_size_m">With Everest to the north and Nuptse to the west, Lhotse forms the apex of the massive horseshoe-shaped arc of the Everest massif. Despite the tremendous vertical relief of its South and Northeast Faces, it is the least prominent of the eight-thousanders due to the great height of the South Col between it and Everest. Lhotse's Western Face, recessed behind the head of the Khumbu Glacier in the Western Cwm, plays an integral part in the standard routes of ascent for both peaks; the name Lhotse, which means "South Peak" in Tibetan, further emphasizes the close relationship between the two.</p></div></article><article class="card"><h2 class="title title_place_card title_size_m">Makalu</h2><div class="card__website"><p class="card__url">URL</p><a target="_blank" class="link link_place_card link_size_m" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makalu">More &rarr;</a></div><img class="card__image" src="176e36fa97acf6f9239b.jpg" alt="Makalu"/><div class="card__text"><p class="text text_place_card text_size_m">Makalu has two notable subsidiary peaks. Kangchungtse, or Makalu II (7,678 m) lies about three kilometres (two miles) north-northwest of the main summit. Rising about 5 km (3 mi) north-northeast of the main summit across a broad plateau, and connected to Kangchungtse by a narrow, 7,200 m saddle, is Chomo Lonzo (7,804 m).</p><p class="text text_place_card text_size_m">The first climb on Makalu was made by an American team led by Riley Keegan in the spring of 1954. The expedition was composed of Sierra Club members including Bill Long and Allen Steck, and was called the California Himalayan Expedition to Makalu.</p></div></article><article class="card"><h2 class="title title_place_card title_size_m">Manaslu</h2><div class="card__website"><p class="card__url">URL</p><a target="_blank" class="link link_place_card link_size_m" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manaslu">More &rarr;</a></div><img class="card__image" src="a52f6533ec9c6b29bc08.jpg" alt="Manaslu"/><div class="card__text"><p class="text text_place_card text_size_m">Manaslu is the highest peak in the Gorkha District and is about 64 km (40 mi) east of Annapurna. The mountain's long ridges and valley glaciers offer feasible approaches from all directions and culminate in a peak that towers steeply above its surrounding landscape and is a dominant feature when viewed from afar.</p><p class="text text_place_card text_size_m">The Manaslu region offers a variety of trekking options. The popular Manaslu trekking route of 177 kilometres (110 mi) skirts the Manaslu massif over the pass down to Annapurna.

It has a summit over 1.5 kilometres (7⁄8 mi) long and, thus, a "broad peak". The first ascent of Broad Peak was made between June 8 and 9, 1957 by Fritz Wintersteller, Marcus Schmuck, Kurt Diemberger, and Hermann Buhl of an Austrian expedition led by Marcus Schmuck. A first attempt by the team was made on May 29 where Fritz Wintersteller and Kurt Diemberger reached the forepeak (8,030 m). This was also accomplished without the aid of supplemental oxygen, high altitude porters or base camp support.</p></div></article></section><section class="cover"><h2 class="title title_place_cover title_size_m">Climb 'em all</h2><p class="subtitle subtitle_place_cover subtitle_size_m">List of highest mountains on Earth</p><div class="cover__background"></div><a target="_blank" class="cover__container" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest_mountains_on_Earth"></a></section></main><footer class="footer"><nav><ul class="footer__links"><li><a class="link link_place_footer link_size_s" href="https://www.google.com/maps">Google Maps</a></li><li><a class="link link_place_footer link_size_s" href="calendar.google.com">Google Calendar</a></li><li><a class="link link_place_footer link_size_s" href="https://www.bbc.com/weather">BBC Weather</a></li></ul></nav><p class="footer__copyright">© Nadia Gorbacheva</p></footer></div></body></html>
